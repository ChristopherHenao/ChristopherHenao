I am a firm believer that living a life confined in a box of comfort will never cultivate success. Because of this, I seek out change, even when it isn't convenient. For these reasons, I know that I will bring a unique perspective to software development and the technology field. I will continue to grow and reinvent myself and my work. I know that ultimately, this can help me become an expert software engineer.
